24. A HashMap in Java is basically a fast key => value storage, kind of like a dictionary. You give it a key (like a String or an int), it hashes it into a bucket, and then lets you quickly store or retrieve an associated value. Most of the time, it does this really fast, and the time for put() and get() are constant. It comes from the Map interface, which means that it supports core operations like adding things (put), looking them up (get), checking to see if something exists (containKey), looping through everything (entrySet/keySet), etc. 
However, it doesn't keep any specific order of the elements, which is bad if you want to sort items.
